**Project Proposal & Hypothesis:**
Using the following dataset we ðŸŽ¹ Spotify Tracks Dataset | Kaggle we aim to answer the following questions and provide a range of visualizations:

**1. How does Genre impact popularity?**

**2. How does Length of Song impact popularity?**

**3. What other attributes impact a song's popularity?**


We will also then utilize this data to complete predictions for the future.

We plan to use Jupyter notebooks for coding and import the following libraries:

import pandas as pd

import numpy as np

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

import seaborn as sns

import plotly.express as px

import plotly.graph_objects as go

from plotly.subplots import make_subplots

import os

import random

from contextlib import contextmanager

from time import time

from tqdm import tqdm

import lightgbm as lgbm

from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, log_loss, accuracy_score

from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

from sklearn.model_selection import KFold

from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder

from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

from sklearn.decomposition import PCA

from sklearn.manifold import TSNE

from sklearn.cluster import KMeans

import warnings

warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')

Further to this we then hosted these visualizations on Tableau Public
