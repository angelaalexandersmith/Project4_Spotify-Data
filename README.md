# Project4_Spotify-Data

Caroline Badocha, Robbie Hockley, Matthew Ford & Angela Alexander Smith.

Project Proposal & Hypothesis:
Using the following dataset we ðŸŽ¹ Spotify Tracks Dataset | Kaggle we aim to answer the following questions and provide a range of visualizations:

How does Genre impact popularity?
How does Length of Song impact popularity?
What other attributes impact a song's popularity?

We will also then utilize this data to complete predictions for the future.

We plan to use Jupyter notebooks for coding and import the following libraries:

import pandas as pd

import numpy as np

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

import plotly.express as px

import plotly.graph_objects as go

from plotly.subplots import make_subplots

from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

Further to this we would then be looking to host these visualizations either on Tableau Public or GitHub Pages.

If time permits we will then look at using an API call to create a world map to represent the most popular artists & genres.
