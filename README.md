Using the following dataset we ðŸŽ¹ Spotify Tracks Dataset | Kaggle we aim to answer the following questions and provide a range of visualizations:

**1. How does Genre impact popularity?**

**2. How does Length of Song impact popularity?**

**3. What other attributes impact a song's popularity?**


## We will also then utilize this data to complete predictions for the future.

## Before implementing machine learning as per the below:

## Further to this we then hosted additional visualizations around the following information : 
**Popularity vs Genre**

**Popularity vs Song Duration**

**Key vs Popularity**

**Band Popularity looking solely at most popular key**

**Most Popular Track of the Most Popular Band identified by key**
